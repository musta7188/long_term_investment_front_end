Smart Long Term Investment APP

This project was build using Ruby as back-end API and React for the front end. 
The App shows a recommendation section available upon login for all the user where the admin can add investment recommendation and show the average return on investment since the open position was placed.
Each user can create and personalize a Smart portfolio where he/she add stock to observe the performance of the stock they bought by including the buying price and the unit. The App also offers a search section and a News section where the user can find and follow the news about the favourite stock.


Getting Started 

Clone the Repostory and run npm install && npm start. Be sure to have the back-end running first.
I suggest to get your own API for Yahoo finance and  Alpha Vangae API find the how here https://www.alphavantage.co/, https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1.
This will make sure the API does not run out of request if you get your own API key and change the one in the APIs Component.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
